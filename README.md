# Queue Management Simulator (Java, Multithreading & Swing)

This project simulates a real-time queue management system in Java. Multiple clients are generated with random arrival and service times and are dynamically assigned to the queue with the shortest waiting time. Each queue is managed using separate threads. The simulation is controlled via a graphical interface built with Java Swing.

---

## 🧠 Features

- Configurable simulation parameters:
  - Number of clients
  - Number of queues
  - Simulation duration
  - Arrival time interval (min/max)
  - Service time interval (min/max)
- Clients are automatically assigned to the optimal queue
- Each queue runs in its own thread using synchronization mechanisms
- Real-time simulation updates via GUI
- Event logging to `logOfEvents.txt`

---

## 🖥️ User Interface

The GUI allows users to:
- Enter simulation parameters
- Start the simulation with a button click
- View live queue status and simulation progress

The interface is implemented using Java Swing and handles input validation and error messages.

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

### 🧪 Model
- `Client`: represents a customer with an ID, arrival time, and service time
- `Queue`: represents a thread-managed queue using `BlockingQueue<Client>`

### ⚙️ BusinessLogic
- `Simulation`: runs the simulation using multithreading and random generation
- `Controller`: manages communication between UI and simulation logic

### 🎨 GUI
- `SimulationFrame`: graphical interface with all interactive components

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Java
- Java Swing (GUI)
- Multithreading with `Runnable` and `BlockingQueue`
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Synchronization mechanisms

---

## 📁 Output

 - The results generated by this application are displayed in the file named `logOfEvents.txt`
 - Each time step in the simulation includes:
```
Time: <current_time>
Waiting clients:
(clientID, arrivalTime, serviceTime)
...

Queue 1:
(clientID, arrivalTime, serviceTime)
...

Queue 2:
(clientID, arrivalTime, serviceTime)
...
```

## 🧪 Test Case Example

This test showcases the simulator running with 4 clients and 2 queues over a 60-second interval.  
Input parameters were provided through the graphical interface, as shown below:

### ✅ Input Parameters:

- **Number of clients:** 4  
- **Number of queues:** 2  
- **Simulation time:** 60 seconds  
- **Arrival time range:** 2 – 30 seconds  
- **Service time range:** 2 – 4 seconds

### 📝 Simulation Behavior (from `Test1.txt`):

- Clients are generated with randomized arrival times and fixed service durations.
- At time `2`, client `(2, 2, 2)` enters **Queue 2**.
- At time `5`, client `(3, 5, 3)` is added to **Queue 2** after the previous client finishes.
- Clients `(1, 29, 3)` and `(4, 30, 3)` wait until the end of the interval before entering queues.
- The simulation logs all events, queue statuses, and remaining wait times every second.
